pageInfo: "'Project is a GO!' is 100% cloud based, easily customisable and intuitive platform to manage your sub-contracts and contractors per project.  Set project specific requirements in terms of contractor document requirements and any further project specific eLearning easily.  Contractors apply to site, provide required docs and complete required eLearning.  From there, project specific documents can be made available to all or specific subbies, updates to key documents can be transmitted via the platform and full transparency is in your hands.  Know when document updates were sent, received and even opened or read.  'Project is a GO!' just takes the critical but repeatable process of Project and contractor communication with your key sub-contractors easy, uncomplicated, secure and more importantly all in one place."
